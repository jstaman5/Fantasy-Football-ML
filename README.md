## How to run models
Make sure you are in the /models directory.
Then type either 
```
python linear_regression.py
```
or
```
python svm.py
```

Both programs will loop through the 4 position csv files in /data. 

svm.py prints out the r2 score and shows the prediction graph.

linear_regression.py also prints r2 score and shows prediction graph along with printing a description of data, heatmap, and pairplot.

## Libraries Needed
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. sklearn
4. matplotlib
5. seaborn
